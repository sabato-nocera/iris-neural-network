# Neural network for Iris recognition

This neural network represents a first approach to Machine Learning.

# Data set description

The dataset used is the "Iris Plants Database" (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), created by R.A. Fisher.
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each (150 total instances), where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 
Attributes informations:
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class: 
      -- Iris Setosa
      -- Iris Versicolour
      -- Iris Virginica
